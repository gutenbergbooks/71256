INTRODUCTION


The demand which followed the issue of the first series of small
reproductions of Piranesi’s etchings has tempted the Publishers to put
forth a further selection. The mine is, indeed, inexhaustible, but all
the etchings, though of great individual interest, are not of equal
value to architects. For them Piranesi serves two main purposes: the
first, a stimulus to the imagination; the second, a store of rich and
expressive detail. In this selection, to assist in the first purpose,
are included a few of his own architectural designs. These do not,
however, in reality exhibit his great imaginative qualities so well as
his interpretations of actual buildings. Although Piranesi was careful
to see that he was always styled “Venetian Architect,” we have no very
reliable evidence that he ever composed a building except on paper,
and such paper plans as he published do not suggest great practical
qualities. It is in his drawings of the ruins of ancient Rome that
he gives us something at once more rare and more valuable than any
ordinary architectural achievement. In them he shows us the inherent
romance buried deep in Roman construction. Through him we learn the
spiritual character of this construction when stripped of all its
worldly ornament. It is true that in his drawings the buildings have
another sort of decoration--a decoration of trees and foliage. In the
eighteenth century the ruins had not yet been cleaned and docketed
into museum specimens, but the romance which Piranesi reveals in arch,
vault, and dome is something deeper than a mere picturesque contrast
with foliage and figures. The romance he shows us is the romance of any
enduring monument. It is the monumental quality of Roman construction
which makes it akin to the great works of Nature, and the trees and
vegetation in Piranesi drawings only help to demonstrate this kinship.
The gesticulating figures serve a similar purpose. They are the men of
a lesser generation gibbering over the work of ancestors they only half
comprehend.

The other and more prosaic service which Piranesi can still render to
architects, and especially in these days of neo-Classic detail, is by
means of his careful drawings of antique ornaments and vases from his
own and his friends’ collections. Here he not only provides us with an
immense fund of detail, but he draws that detail in a way which gives
us at once the very essence of its character. It is a character all may
not love, but few can avoid feeling how suitable it is to the age in
which we live.

_Some Famous Buildings and their Story._

              BY A. W. CLAPHAM, F.S.A., AND W. H. GODFREY.


Buildings that have been the scene of historical events, or have played
a distinctive part in the development of national life, are commonly
dealt with either at length in a most unattractive style, or dismissed
in a few sentences embodying dates and particulars which are frequently
inaccurate. Thus, the general reader finds himself confronted with
two extremes, alike unsatisfactory. It was with the express object of
correcting these deficiencies in respect of certain famous buildings
that the authors compiled the series of short papers which constitute
the volume under notice. They have been at great pains in their task,
and, as the result of much original research, a flood of fresh light
is thrown upon the subjects dealt with, every chapter adding some
new fact to previous knowledge, or reproducing some hitherto unknown
or neglected plan. In this way we have set before us, by means of
description and illustration, the most remarkable of all Henry VIII.’s
palaces--Nonsuch, in Surrey, whose wanton destruction was probably
the heaviest loss which English architecture has suffered since the
Dissolution of the Monasteries.

The Tower of London, dealt with in another chapter, offers a wealth
of interest when critical research and architectural acumen are
brought into play, and in the same way the Royal Palace of Eltham,
Northumberland House, Sir Thomas More’s House at Chelsea, the Fortune
Theatre, Barking Abbey, and other famous buildings are dealt with.

  One Volume.                  =5s.= NETT.                  275 pages.
