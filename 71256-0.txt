INTRODUCTION


The demand which followed the issue of the first series of small
reproductions of Piranesi’s etchings has tempted the Publishers to put
forth a further selection. The mine is, indeed, inexhaustible, but all
the etchings, though of great individual interest, are not of equal
value to architects. For them Piranesi serves two main purposes: the
first, a stimulus to the imagination; the second, a store of rich and
expressive detail. In this selection, to assist in the first purpose,
are included a few of his own architectural designs. These do not,
however, in reality exhibit his great imaginative qualities so well as
his interpretations of actual buildings. Although Piranesi was careful
to see that he was always styled “Venetian Architect,” we have no very
reliable evidence that he ever composed a building except on paper,
and such paper plans as he published do not suggest great practical
qualities. It is in his drawings of the ruins of ancient Rome that
he gives us something at once more rare and more valuable than any
ordinary architectural achievement. In them he shows us the inherent
romance buried deep in Roman construction. Through him we learn the
spiritual character of this construction when stripped of all its
worldly ornament. It is true that in his drawings the buildings have
another sort of decoration--a decoration of trees and foliage. In the
eighteenth century the ruins had not yet been cleaned and docketed
into museum specimens, but the romance which Piranesi reveals in arch,
vault, and dome is something deeper than a mere picturesque contrast
with foliage and figures. The romance he shows us is the romance of any
enduring monument. It is the monumental quality of Roman construction
which makes it akin to the great works of Nature, and the trees and
vegetation in Piranesi drawings only help to demonstrate this kinship.
The gesticulating figures serve a similar purpose. They are the men of
a lesser generation gibbering over the work of ancestors they only half
comprehend.

The other and more prosaic service which Piranesi can still render to
architects, and especially in these days of neo-Classic detail, is by
means of his careful drawings of antique ornaments and vases from his
own and his friends’ collections. Here he not only provides us with an
immense fund of detail, but he draws that detail in a way which gives
us at once the very essence of its character. It is a character all may
not love, but few can avoid feeling how suitable it is to the age in
which we live.

_Some Famous Buildings and their Story._

              BY A. W. CLAPHAM, F.S.A., AND W. H. GODFREY.


Buildings that have been the scene of historical events, or have played
a distinctive part in the development of national life, are commonly
dealt with either at length in a most unattractive style, or dismissed
in a few sentences embodying dates and particulars which are frequently
inaccurate. Thus, the general reader finds himself confronted with
two extremes, alike unsatisfactory. It was with the express object of
correcting these deficiencies in respect of certain famous buildings
that the authors compiled the series of short papers which constitute
the volume under notice. They have been at great pains in their task,
and, as the result of much original research, a flood of fresh light
is thrown upon the subjects dealt with, every chapter adding some
new fact to previous knowledge, or reproducing some hitherto unknown
or neglected plan. In this way we have set before us, by means of
description and illustration, the most remarkable of all Henry VIII.’s
palaces--Nonsuch, in Surrey, whose wanton destruction was probably
the heaviest loss which English architecture has suffered since the
Dissolution of the Monasteries.

The Tower of London, dealt with in another chapter, offers a wealth
of interest when critical research and architectural acumen are
brought into play, and in the same way the Royal Palace of Eltham,
Northumberland House, Sir Thomas More’s House at Chelsea, the Fortune
Theatre, Barking Abbey, and other famous buildings are dealt with.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
